# Garmin/Spotify Health & Music Analysis

This project explores how my Garmin health data relates to my Spotify listening habits. I used Python to process and analyze time-series data, apply NLP to the song lyrics, and cluster wellness patterns.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**, **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (data visualization)
- **HuggingFace Transformers** (sentiment analysis)
- **scikit-learn** (KMeans, Silhouette Score)
- **API Integration**: Garmin Connect, Genius
- **Data wrangling**, **feature engineering**, **unsupervised learning**

## Development Steps

- Merged multiple APIs to combine health & music data
- Classified lyrical sentiment using transformer-based NLP models
- Clustered wellness patterns using KMeans
- Analyzed patterns between music sentiment and daily health stats like:
  - Calories
  - Steps
  - Sleep hours
  - Stress levels

## Highlights

- Built a lightweight personal data pipeline to combine health and music data
- Explored connections between music behavior and mental/physical health
- Demonstrated knowledge of data analysis, natural language processing, unsupervised machine learning, and API-based data engineering
